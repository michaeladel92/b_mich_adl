Its a Shoping website where you can Check for Items you want to buy, navbar there are categories list for each item, there is a search button for searching something specific, 
inside each item a description and you can comment ,
it designed with an admin panel control entered throuh another URL & the admin can check total [users, items,comments,pending users] admin also can delete/Edit [users, items,comments,categories], can create new categories and sub categories if needed , 
this website made in native php, its for training purposes ,
it's not 100% completed 

i've uploaded the website in free hosting
http://www.shop-b-mich-adl.ml
check out the admin panel:
http://www.shop-b-mich-adl.ml/admins/
username ==> admin
password ==> 12345
please do not delete any stuff as its only for view purpose for my resume, and its not 100% secured.

if you want try at your local host:
1.download the files and put it in the htdocs [local server Xampp] 
2.there is file called b_mich_adl.sql that has the database for the website, upload it in phpmyadmin localhost. 
3. make sure the connection.php inside folder include
